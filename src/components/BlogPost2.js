										Some people hold themselves accountable by logging work on
										productivity apps, while others turn to blogs and books
										inspirational productivity quotes. Regardless of how you{" "}
										<span className="text-gray-800">motivate yourself</span> to
										get things done in the workplace, now and then we all find
										ourselves searching for productivity tips to keep us moving
										forward. And if you don&apos;t think this applies to you,
										consider this:{" "}
										<span className="text-red-500">
											research suggests that in an eight-hour workday, the
											average worker is only productive for two hours and 53
											minutes.
										</span>{" "}
										That leaves a lot of room for improvement.
									</p>
									<p className="mb-4">
										Before you do anything else, take a few moments at the start
										of each day to organize and declutter your workspace. A
										clutter-free environment helps you think more clearly and
										produce better results, said Kristoph Matthews, head of
										engineering at NewtonX and founder of on-demand storage
										company Boxbee. By{" "}
										<a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7456-workspace-design-productivity.html">
											cleaning up and organizing your space
										</a>
										, you can greatly{" "}
										<span className="text-gray-800">increase</span> your
										productivity and limit the time you spend searching for
										items.
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										Understand how your brain works & when you are most
										productive. For me, I&apos;ve gotten rid of lunch meetings
										to keep my productive time going as long as I can.
									</blockquote>
									<p className="mb-4">
										Color can have a major effect on your mood and productivity
										throughout the day, said Jenny Gauld, interior designer for
										office furniture and accessory retailer Turnstone. Blue can
										impart a calming feeling and help you focus, while red may
										be great for work requiring accuracy and attention to
										detail. Plants can also help people focus: A study by the{" "}
										<a href="https://journals.ashs.org/horttech/view/journals/horttech/30/1/article-p55.xml">
											American Society for Horticultural Science
										</a>{" "}
										found that workers who were exposed to plants in their
										workspace reported feeling less stressed and more
										productive.
									</p>
									<p className="mb-4">
										In addition to adding{" "}
										<span className="font-bold text-gray-800">some color</span>{" "}
										and plants to your workspace, decorating your desk or
										cubicle with a few personal knickknacks can help you feel
										more relaxed, which can boost your productivity. Gauld
										suggested adding meaningful career memorabilia, such as
										diplomas, awards, and other decorative items that help you
										feel appreciated and will motivate you.
									</p>

									<p className="mb-4">
										Everyone has at least one task on the to-do list that keeps
										getting pushed back because the thought of doing it seems
										awful. That task is actually the one you should complete
										first, according to Matthews. Instead of waiting until the
										last minute to finish it, get it off your plate as soon as
										possible. Your other tasks will seem less daunting by
										comparison, and you&apos;ll stop stressing about that one
										task all day, making you more productive overall.
									</p>

									<p className="mb-4">
										People vary in terms of when they are most productive. For
										example, are you a morning person or a night owl? It&apos;s
										important to identify which hours of the day you feel most
										alert and attentive, and then dedicate those hours to your
										most important tasks. This is especially useful if you work
										remotely and can determine your schedule.
									</p>

									<p className="mb-4">
										If you can&apos;t create a schedule around your most
										productive work time, consider organizing your priorities in
										your current schedule based on which hours of your workday
										you feel most alert. Your productivity peaks are often in 90
										- to 120-minute intervals.
									</p>
									<p className="mb-4">
										It can be hard to improve your productivity. These easy tips
										can help you be more productive without a herculean effort.
									</p>
									<ul className="list-style">
										<li>
											Create a workspace that is clean, comfortable, decorative
											and free from distractions.
										</li>
										<li>
											It can be helpful to take short breaks, move around,
											switch locations, put on some music, meditate and eat
											lunch with your co-workers.
										</li>
										<li>
											Create daily goals and to-do lists to prioritize and
											delegate your tasks efficiently.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p className="mb-4">
										Whether it&apos;s taking a walk, going to your favorite
										coffee shop, reading a magazine or visiting with a
										colleague, taking short breaks that are unrelated to your
										work can make a huge difference in your performance. Your
										productivity diminishes the longer you go without a break.
										Kobel explained that this is why it&apos;s recommended that
										people don&apos;t work more than eight to 10 hours per day.
										At a certain point, she said, your body and mind simply
										cannot produce anymore.
									</p>

									<p className="mb-4">
										Exercise isn&apos;t just good for your body; it can also
										positively impact your work performance. Physical exercise
										has been shown to affect mental health and focus, said Sam
										McIntire, founder of{" "}
										<a href="https://www.deskbright.com/">Deskbright</a>, an
										online learning platform dedicated to helping entrepreneurs
										and employees. A great way to feel sharper and more
										productive? Try going for a run in the morning or starting
										your day with a workout, McIntire suggested. It doesn&apos;t
										hurt to sneak in some exercise on your breaks either.
									</p>

									<p className="mb-4">
										It&apos;s not always easy to keep track of everything you
										need to do, so start each morning by writing down your goals
										for the day. When your focus is broken or you find yourself
										procrastinating, McIntire said, you can use the list to keep
										you on track, said McIntire. He suggested writing your list
										down on a Post-it or something that&apos;s visible from your
										desk, then returning to it when you need a reminder of what
										you should be working on.
									</p>

									<p className="mb-4">
										Doing more than one thing at a time may seem like the best
										way to get all of your tasks done, but it can hurt your
										productivity more than it helps. Multitasking simply
										doesn&apos;t work, and when you do it, you end up wasting
										time, Kobel said.
